core/two_stage_utils.py

Standalone home for the handful of two_stage_asymmetric.py functions that
two_stage_multiclass.py (and two_stage_multiclass_runner.py) import and
reuse UNCHANGED -- because they were already class-count-agnostic, nothing
about them needed to change for the multiclass generalization (see
two_stage_multiclass.py's module docstring, which explains exactly this).

Moved here (out of two_stage_asymmetric.py) since that file has been
deleted from this repo; two_stage_multiclass.py now imports these from
core.two_stage_utils instead of two_stage.two_stage_asymmetric.

Each function below is a byte-for-byte-equivalent port of the original
two_stage_asymmetric.py definition (only docstrings/formatting added):

    generate_view_combinations           (originally line 59)
    generate_combination_costs_heterogeneous  (originally line 55)
    generate_per_view_costs              (originally line 48)
    match_cluster_labels                 (originally line 16)
    calculate_two_stage_error            (originally line 458, as calculate_two_phase_error)

No other two_stage_asymmetric.py functions are needed by the multiclass
path -- everything else there (predict_combo / predict_single_combination,
initialize_centers, combo_closed_form_reward, run_alg,
run_inference_lp_colgen, solve_LP / run_inference_lp) was either K=2-
specific and re-implemented in two_stage_multiclass.py, or unused by the
multiclass runner (the legacy exhaustive-enumeration LP path).
