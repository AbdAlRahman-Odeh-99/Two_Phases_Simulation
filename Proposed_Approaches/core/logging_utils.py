"""
core/logging_utils.py

One shared home for everything about a RUN that is not the run's numbers:
identity, provenance, console/file logging, fine-grained timing, progress
heartbeats, crash-resilient row checkpointing, per-cell failure isolation,
and the optional per-round trace sidecar.

=== Why this exists ===
Before this module every runner did its observability with bare `print()`
to stdout, and recorded exactly three timings per row -- train, inference,
seed. Under PBS that meant:

  * stdout is captured into one .o file, buffered, and interleaved with
    every other message, so a 10-hour job gave no usable progress signal;
  * nothing tied a results_*.xlsx back to the code that produced it (no
    commit, no argv, no library versions, no job id);
  * a walltime kill at seed 8/10 threw away all eight completed seeds,
    because rows only reached disk in the final save_results_to_excel;
  * one bad cell (a degenerate LP, a missing class in a split) killed the
    whole sweep;
  * "why is lp_full slow?" was unanswerable -- train_time_sec lumps the
    acquisition policy, the arm-reward replay and the dual update together.

Every piece below exists to fix exactly one of those.

=== The five things a runner uses ===

1. setup_run(...) -> RunContext
   Called ONCE from an entry point's __main__, before any work. Assigns the
   run_id, creates logs/ and results/, installs the logging handlers, and
   writes the provenance manifest. Everything else finds it via get_run().

2. get_logger(__name__) / logging
   Replaces print. INFO goes to console AND file; DEBUG to the file only.

3. tick("t_acquisition") / cell_timers()
   Fine-grained timing. `cell_timers()` opens a fresh bucket for one sweep
   cell and yields the dict it will fill; any `tick(name)` executed inside
   it -- including deep inside core.lp_colgen, which knows nothing about
   the runner -- accumulates into that bucket. That indirection is the
   whole point: instrumenting the pricing loop costs one `with` statement
   and NO signature change anywhere between it and the runner.

4. Progress(total).step()
   Heartbeat with ETA, so a running job says where it is.

5. guard(cell) + run.emit_row(row)
   Per-cell failure isolation and append-as-you-go checkpointing. Rows land
   in results/{run_id}.rows.jsonl the moment they are produced.

=== What this module deliberately does NOT do ===
It never touches the numbers. No metric is computed here, no row is
rewritten, no aggregation changes. Every existing column keeps its name and
meaning; the new ones are appended. A run with logging fully disabled
(setup_run never called) behaves exactly as before -- every function here
degrades to a no-op when there is no active RunContext, so the runners stay
importable and runnable as plain library code, e.g. from a notebook.

    ----------

    args : argparse.Namespace or dict or None
        The RESOLVED arguments -- what the run actually used, after
        defaults and after 'all' -> None style normalisation. Recorded
        verbatim in the manifest. This, not argv, is what answers "what
        did this run do"; argv is kept alongside for the copy-pasteable
        reproduction command.
    name_hint : str
        Usually the output .xlsx stem. The run_id is built from it, so the
        log, the manifest, the JSONL checkpoint and the workbook all share
        one name and sort together in a directory listing.
