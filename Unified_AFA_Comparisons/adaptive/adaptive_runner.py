Driver for adaptive.py:

  - Data via core.datasets.load_dataset_as_numpy -- same contract as every
    other runner. Works on ANY registered dataset: for the 5 real binary
    datasets and synthetic_asymmetric/synthetic_symmetric, nclasses is
    INFERRED from the labels (= 2, where the multiclass algorithm reduces
    to nearest-mean binary classification); for "synthetic",
    the synthetic_n_classes knob controls how many classes are GENERATED.
  - Costs: fixed per-dataset heterogeneous costs
    (generate_modality_costs_heterogeneous), view 0 free, normalized so
    sum(costs) == 1 -- identical convention to the other runners, NOT the
    notebook's per-trial cost redraw.
  - Split: selectable with split_mode. Use 80-20 for proposed-method
    comparisons, or 60-20-20 when comparing with EDDI/DIME.
    Each seed gets its own split, center init, and inference-phase sampling rng -- this
    REPLACES the notebook's buggy trial loop, where generate_data and
    simulation were re-seeded with the SAME args.seed every trial so all
    trials saw identical data (only costs varied).
  - est_means_init: nclasses distinct rows of X_train, drawn once per seed
    and reused across budget fractions (repo convention, generalizing the
    binary runners' 2-row init; replaces the notebook's rng.normal init).
  - Budget: total_budget = budget_fraction * n_total, train/inference
    split auto-derived as n_train/n_total -- identical to the other
    runners.
  - Inference phase: core.lp_colgen.solve_lp_policy_colgen_multiclass
    (multiclass column generation) -- tractable at any nviews, same as the
    binary colgen path.

`feedback` ("full" | "bandit") selects the training-phase update rule --
see adaptive.run_training_phase.

`acquisition` ("greedy" | "lp_chain" | "lp_full") selects the training-phase
ACQUISITION policy, orthogonally to `feedback`:
  greedy    per-round submodular greedy + OMD dual (default; unchanged)
  lp_chain  UCB reward estimates over the nviews+1 nested greedy chain,
            with the per-round budgeted LP solved exactly each round
  lp_full   the same, over the FULL 2^(nviews-1) enumeration -- the
            small-nviews fidelity check for what the chain costs
`reward_update` ("subsets" | "selected") controls whether a round scores
every arm contained in the played subset (counterfactual replay) or only
the played arm. Ignored under acquisition="greedy". See
adaptive.py's ACQUISITION MODES docstring section. Results dicts have the
The per-fraction results use the common proposed-method schema (so
run_proposed_methods._normalize_frac_keyed_results applies unchanged);
feedback / n_classes are experiment-level settings the caller records.

=== Observability (see core/logging_utils.py) ===
Same treatment as the two_stage runner: logging instead of print, a
per-cell `guard` so one failure does not end the sweep, append-as-you-go
row checkpointing to results/{run_id}.rows.jsonl, a Progress heartbeat with
an ETA, and the fine timing decomposition alongside the untouched
train/inference/seed timings.

One structural note specific to THIS runner: its results object is a
dict-of-lists keyed by budget fraction, and every list must stay the same
length or the per-seed alignment breaks. So a failed cell appends a full
row of NaNs rather than being skipped -- CELL_FIELDS below is the single
list that keeps the success and failure paths in step.

        values, LP solved once before the loop, each round a draw from the
        frozen distribution). "lp_full_opt" needs the generative means and
        so is SYNTHETIC-ONLY; this function recovers them itself via
        core.optimal_static.synthetic_true_means and raises for any real
        dataset. It is also the one mode that ignores synthetic_seed drift:
        the means are re-derived from synthetic_seed / synthetic_mean_scale
        / synthetic_n_classes, so those must match what generated X_full --
        they do here by construction, since the same values feed
        load_dataset_as_numpy a few lines above.
    reward_update: "subsets" or "selected". Used by lp_chain/lp_full and by
        greedy when reward_estimate="empirical". Ignored by surrogate greedy
        and lp_full_opt.
    synthetic_n_classes: "synthetic" only. For every other
        dataset, nclasses is inferred from the labels.
    alpha_ucb / lr: training-phase exploration bonus scale and (bandit-only)
        complementary-update learning rate -- notebook defaults.
    run_inference: if False, ONLY the training phase (adaptive online
        training) executes; the inference-phase column-generation LP +
        physical-sampling inference is skipped entirely. The train/inference
        split and budget pools are unchanged (the inference budget is just
        never spent); all inference_* metrics are set to NaN, inference
        spent/time to 0.0, num_masks_inference to NaN, and total_reward
        becomes the TRAIN-ONLY figure (== ph1 train_reward, already the
        accuracy over all n_train rounds) rather than the sample-weighted
        train+inference figure -- so
        a run_inference=False total_reward is NOT directly comparable to a
        full run's. Use it when you only care about training dynamics.
    image_data_home: mnist/fashion_mnist only -- where fetch_openml caches
        its download. See core.datasets.DEFAULT_OPENML_DATA_HOME's comment:
        defaults to a relative "data/openml_cache" folder rather than
        fetch_openml's own ~/scikit_learn_data, since $HOME's quota is tiny
        (and often already exhausted) on clusters like NCI Gadi.
