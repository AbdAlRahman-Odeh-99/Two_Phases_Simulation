core/lp_colgen.py

Column-generation replacement for the stochastic inference LP,
ported from constrained_supervised_training_submodular_gmm2c.ipynb's
`optimal_branch_and_bound`. Solves the SAME linear program that
`solve_lp_policy` solves (maximize expected reward over a distribution
on view subsets, subject to a per-round budget constraint and the
probability simplex), but WITHOUT ever materializing the full
`2**nviews - 1` power set of subsets.

Instead, it solves a small "restricted master problem" LP over a growing
set of discovered columns (subsets), and at each iteration uses the
master problem's dual variables to run a pruned branch-and-bound search
(the "pricing subproblem") for a single new subset with negative reduced
cost -- i.e. one that would improve the LP objective if added. This
relies on the reward function (`lp_reward`) being monotone in the
included views, so the "assume every remaining feature gets added" bound
is a valid relaxation for pruning.

`lp_reward` uses the SAME formula as `gain_func` / the notebook's
`optimal_branch_and_bound` (which itself calls `gain_func`, with the
extra 0.5 factor in its argument) -- NOT the no-0.5 `norm.sf(sqrt(snr))`
formula this codebase's `combo_reward_estimates` currently uses. See
`lp_reward`'s own docstring for the exact discrepancy.

This makes inference tractable at ANY nviews, including physionet (41) and
miniboone (50), where `enumerate_subsets(nviews)` cannot even be built in
memory, let alone optimized over.

Shared by gmm_2class_submodular_asymmetric.py and
gmm_2class_bandit_asymmetric.py -- both use the same reward-formula
convention questions (gain_func vs. combo_reward_estimates), so one
pricing routine serves both.

One deliberate adaptation relative to the notebook's version: the free
view (index 0) is seeded as the initial active column instead of starting
column generation from the empty set, matching this codebase's "free view
always observed" convention (see `enumerate_subsets` / `greedy_oracle` /
`get_subset` in the algorithm files). The branch-and-bound pricing
subproblem then only ever branches over PAID views (indices 1..nviews-1);
the free view is fixed True in every candidate subset it proposes.

=== Instrumentation note ===
Both solvers split their loop into the two halves that actually cost
something, and time them separately: t_master_lp for the restricted-master
linprog call and t_pricing for the branch-and-bound subproblem, with
n_colgen_iters counting the rounds. This is the decomposition the previous
single inference_time_sec could not give: at 40+ views the pricing search
dominates and the master is free, while at low view counts with many
discovered columns the reverse can hold, and the two point at completely
different fixes.

COLGEN_ITER_WARN below is a WARNING THRESHOLD, not a cap -- the loop's
termination conditions are unchanged. It exists because an inference solve
that quietly takes thousands of iterations is a real failure mode with no
visible symptom other than a slow job.
