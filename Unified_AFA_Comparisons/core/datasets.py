"""
Standalone loaders for AFA-Benchmark datasets, replicating
afabench/datasets/datasets.py's preprocessing without needing their Hydra /
Snakemake / bundle scaffolding.

BINARY (2-class) tabular:
  - "ckd"             CKDDataset            UCI id=336, auto-fetched
  - "bank_marketing"  BankMarketingDataset  UCI id=222, auto-fetched
  - "actg175"         ACTG175Dataset        UCI id=890, auto-fetched
  - "miniboone"       MiniBooNEDataset      local CSV required (no auto-fetch
                                            in the original code either)
  - "physionet"       PhysionetDataset      local CSV required (data-use
                                            agreement)

MULTICLASS (K>2) -- runnable on the multiclass methods (submodular /
two_stage) only:
  - "diabetes"        3-class NHANES-derived diabetes status. LOCAL CSV
                      required (3-class target as the LAST column) -- the
                      exact AFA preprocessing isn't publicly auto-fetchable.
                      Goes through the SAME tabular pipeline as the UCI
                      datasets (now class-count-inferring, not 2-hardcoded).
  - "mnist"           10-class handwritten digits, fetched via OpenML
                      (sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml, id=554).
  - "fashion_mnist"   10-class clothing items, OpenML id=40996.
                      Both images are treated as TABULAR pixels ([0,1]-scaled)
                      with OPTIONAL block-average downsampling from 28x28 to
                      x*x (see average_pool_images / the image_pool_side arg).

SYNTHETIC GMM: "synthetic_asymmetric" / "synthetic_symmetric" (2-class),
"synthetic" (K-class).

The tabular datasets share the original code's pipeline: label-encode
categoricals (non-missing entries only), coerce to numeric, mean-impute,
z-normalize (population stats, ddof=0), one-hot the (label-encoded) target.
Implemented once as _preprocess_features, reused by all tabular loaders.

Requires: pip install ucimlrepo pandas torch scikit-learn numpy
(MNIST/FashionMNIST use scikit-learn's fetch_openml, which caches the
download under ~/scikit_learn_data.)

    Ignored for synthetic datasets (nothing is read from disk).

    max_modalities: for REAL datasets, keeps only the first N feature
        columns. For SYNTHETIC datasets, has NO effect here -- pass the

    max_samples: caps a REAL dataset to at most this many rows (see

        synthetic_n_samples instead, which controls how many rows get

    synthetic_*: only used when dataset_name is in SYNTHETIC_DATASETS.

    synthetic_n_classes: "synthetic" only -- how many classes to

    image_data_home: MNIST/FashionMNIST only -- see
        load_binary_afa_dataset's docstring / DEFAULT_OPENML_DATA_HOME's
        comment (defaults to a relative "data/openml_cache" folder instead
        of fetch_openml's own ~/scikit_learn_data, which blows $HOME's
