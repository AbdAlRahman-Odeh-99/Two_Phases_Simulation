core/optimal_static.py

Optimal STATIC (fixed-distribution) acquisition policy over view
combinations, computed from the KNOWN generative means -- the oracle
benchmark the two_stage Stage-2 EXP4/Hedge-BwK bandit is trying to
converge to, and the same LP that main_LP_true_means_rem.py's
`solve_LP` solves, generalized to K classes and to this codebase's
heterogeneous per-view cost convention.

    max_D  sum_c D(c) * acc(c)
    s.t.   sum_c D(c) * cost(c) <= budget_per_sample
           sum_c D(c) = 1,  D(c) >= 0

acc(c) is the EMPIRICAL accuracy of nearest-centroid prediction using the
TRUE class means restricted to combination c, measured on the same rounds
the comparator is being compared against. Using empirical accuracy (rather
than core.lp_colgen.multiclass_reward's Bhattacharyya proxy) is deliberate:
the number this benchmark is compared to -- run_alg_multiclass's
`error_rate` -- is an empirical 0/1 error rate, so the benchmark has to be
on the same scale to be interpretable. multiclass_reward is a monotone
surrogate used for PRICING inside column generation, and its values are not
accuracies.

=== SYNTHETIC DATA ONLY ===
This needs the true generative means, so it is only defined for the
synthetic GMM datasets (core.datasets.SYNTHETIC_GENERATORS). There is no
meaningful "true mean" for ckd/mnist/etc., and substituting the sample mean
would silently turn the benchmark into a plug-in estimate that the
algorithm can (and on a finite sample sometimes does) beat -- which would
make it useless as a bound. Callers must gate on the dataset name;
`synthetic_true_means` raises for anything else.

=== WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT A BOUND ON ===
IS: a lower bound on the error of any NON-ADAPTIVE policy -- i.e. any
policy that draws the view subset from a fixed distribution that does not
depend on the sample x_t. two_stage's Stage 2 is exactly such a policy
(run_alg_multiclass's expert weights never look at x[t]), so this is the
right comparator for `error_rate` / `inference_error` there.

IS NOT: a bound for ADAPTIVE acquisition. A policy that chooses which
paid views to buy AFTER seeing the free view can beat any fixed
distribution, so the greedy/submodular per-sample methods in this repo may
legitimately fall BELOW this number. Do not report it as a floor for them.

=== THE THREE COMPARATORS ARE NOT NESTED ===
The runner reports this benchmark at three (budget, horizon, row-set)
settings: the Stage-2 training rounds, the inference rounds, and the whole
horizon. They are measured on DIFFERENT sample sets, so they are not
ordered relative to each other -- opt_static_error_full can come out very
slightly BELOW or ABOVE the Stage-2 figure purely from which rows each
averages over, even though the whole-horizon budget is weakly larger.
Compare each only to its own algorithm-side number:
    opt_static_error_stage2    <-> run_alg_multiclass's error_rate
    opt_static_error_inference <-> inference_error
    opt_static_error_full      <-> a gamma-independent reference line
Only within a fixed row set is the error monotone in the budget.

Two further relaxations, both of which only make the benchmark more
permissive (so the direction of the bound is safe):
  - The hard running budget is relaxed to an EXPECTED per-round budget
    (b_ub = budget_per_sample), as in the standard BwK LP benchmark. The
    real algorithms face a hard budget with an absorbing free-view fallback
    once it is exhausted.
  - acc(c) is measured on the same samples the LP optimizes over, so it is
    an in-sample optimum with no estimation error whatsoever.

    `np.random.default_rng(synthetic_seed)` and the generator's very first
    consumption of it is `means = rng.random(size=(K, n_views)) * mean_scale`,
    so replaying that one draw here reproduces the means bit-for-bit
    (verified by direct comparison). make_blobs then assigns label k to
    centers[k], so row k is class k's mean and NO Hungarian matching is
    needed -- same reasoning as initialize_centers_multiclass's supervised
    init (see two_stage_multiclass.py's module docstring).

    synthetic_n_views: the value passed to the GENERATOR (--n-views). The

        but entirely wrong means, and the resulting "bound" would sit at the
        wrong level rather than visibly failing.

        `features[:, :max_modalities]` to synthetic datasets too -- its
        docstring says max_modalities has "no effect" for synthetic, which is
