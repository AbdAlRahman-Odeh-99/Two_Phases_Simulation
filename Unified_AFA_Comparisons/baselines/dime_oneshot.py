class DIMEOneShot(nn.Module):
    '''
    One-shot (open-loop) version of DIME's selection rule, built from a
    TRAINED CMIEstimator. Training is left completely untouched --
    CMIEstimator is used exactly as-is, fit via its usual
    pytorch_lightning Trainer. Nothing here subclasses or modifies it.

    How it relates to DIME's own adaptive inference (predict_step):

      DIME (adaptive, closed-loop):
        repeat until stopping criterion fires:
          1. query value_network on current x_masked -> per-feature CMI
          2. pick argmax(CMI / feature_costs) among unobserved features
          3. acquire it, update the mask, RE-QUERY the value network

      This class (one-shot, open-loop):
          1. query value_network ONCE, at the initial state (free
             modality only) -> per-feature CMI estimates
          2. rank paid modalities by CMI / feature_costs (DIME's exact
             per-step rule)
          3. commit to acquiring them greedily in that order, in a
             single decision, until the budget is exhausted or predicted
             CMI stops being positive (DIME's own positive-CMI check)

    Everything DIME-specific is preserved: the learned value network IS
    the selection mechanism, the same cmi_scaling transforms are applied
    ('bounded' -> sigmoid * entropy, 'positive' -> softplus, 'none' ->
    raw), the same cost normalization, the same positive-CMI acceptance
    check, and the same budget-mode stopping semantics as predict_step's
    mode='budget'. The ONLY change is that the CMI estimates are frozen
    at the initial mask instead of being re-estimated after each
    acquisition -- i.e. the feedback loop is removed, which is precisely
    the one-shot restriction.

    If no paid modality has positive predicted CMI, or none fits the
    budget, the sample falls back to the free modality (index 0) alone.

    Args:
      cmi_estimator: a TRAINED CMIEstimator instance. Its value_network,
        predictor, mask_layer, and cmi_scaling are all reused.
      feature_costs: list of per-modality costs; feature_costs[0] must be
        0 (the free modality, always observed).

        One-shot selection: a single value-network query per sample at the

            already-chosen subset (ranked/committed exactly as before) is
            checked against a SHARED, depleting pool via
            apply_global_budget_fallback, forcing a fallback to the free
            modality once the pool is exhausted -- mirroring
            run_phase2_inference's global depletion + forced-fallback
            semantics (not skip-and-continue-to-cheaper-option; see that
            function's docstring). Samples are processed in the order
            given in `x`, so results are order-dependent under this mode,
            same as the GMM-bandit method's own Phase 2.
