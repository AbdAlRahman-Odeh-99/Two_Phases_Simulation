EDDI: one-shot (open-loop) feature/modality selection.

NOTE: this file previously held TWO variants -- an exhaustive
candidate-SUBSET-scoring EDDI (class `EDDI`) and this ranked,
per-feature-scoring variant (class `EDDIRanked`, in a separate file
eddi_oneshot_ranked.py). The exhaustive-subset variant has been REMOVED
by request; this file now contains ONLY the ranked variant, renamed to
`EDDI` (the plain/standard EDDI used everywhere else in this codebase).
eddi_oneshot_ranked.py no longer exists -- import EDDI from here instead
of EDDIRanked from that file.

class EDDI(nn.Module):
    '''
    One-shot EDDI, converted as a MINIMAL reduction of the original
    (sequential) EDDI's own per-feature scoring loop -- structurally
    parallel to how DIMEOneShot was derived from CMIEstimator.

    Original (sequential) EDDI, per step k of max_features:
      1. impute unobserved features at the CURRENT mask (re-sampled
         every step)
      2. for each remaining feature j: tentatively add it, predict,
         score via calculate_criterion -- ONE FEATURE AT A TIME
      3. argmax over those per-feature scores -> acquire ONE feature
      4. repeat from 1, now conditioned on the larger mask

    This class (one-shot, open-loop):
      1. impute unobserved features ONCE, at the initial (free-only) state
      2. score every paid feature INDIVIDUALLY, exactly like the
         original's own per-feature loop -- but only ONCE, not
         re-run after each acquisition
      3. rank all paid features by that single-pass score (optionally
         cost-normalized via the cost_normalized flag)
      4. commit to a subset via a single greedy walk down that fixed
         ranking, filling the budget (skip an unaffordable feature,
         keep checking cheaper ones further down)

    The only thing frozen/removed relative to the original sequential
    EDDI is the RE-IMPUTATION-AND-RE-SCORING loop between acquisitions --
    exactly analogous to what DIMEOneShot removes from CMIEstimator's
    per-step re-querying. The per-feature (not per-subset) scoring
    mechanism itself is preserved unchanged, matching the original's own
    algorithm shape.

    Args:
      sampler: model with an `.impute(x, mask)` method (e.g. PVAE).
      predictor: trained classifier/regressor over (masked_x, mask).
      mask_layer: MaskLayerGrouped instance.
      task: 'classification' or 'regression'.
      feature_costs: list of per-modality costs, or None. feature_costs[0]
        must be 0 (the free modality, always observed) if given.
      cost_normalized: if True (default), rank by score/cost (gain-per-cost).
        If False, rank by raw score under the hard budget filter (spends
        up to the budget instead of optimizing efficiency).
